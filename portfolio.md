## mmotel
#### Founder · Branding · UI Designer · Frontend Engineer

mmotel is a web application for booking motel rooms in Colombia. Is currently under active development.

The logo, ui design and the final frontend version are made by me. The first version of the frontend was a learning exercise on frontend technologies for a developer friend. The backend runs in [Parse]()

The following are mid-res mockups of the app made in Sketch.

## Auxo
#### Frontend Engineer mostly

 Development Agency focused on web and mobile apps based in Bogotá, Colombia. I worked for them for almost a year in several projects.

##### Appto
An online real estate agency. https://appto.co/ I did the first web prototype almost a year ago. It has come a long way since then.

##### Viu

Exterior advertisement monitoring.

 * I developed a native Android app to allow the operators to take a geotagged photo of the ad and upload it to the backend.

 * I also did a AWS Lambda function to correct the rotation EXIF information so the photo would appear correctly positioned wherever it was displayed. You can check the code here:

 * I built two BIRT reports to display the collected information in a Business Intelligence manner. You can check one of those [here](/projects/others/belleza.pdf).

 * Since BIRT required the maps in the reports to be static images, I developed an Express url based API to connect to a PhantomJS instance that consumed an AngularJS application that displayed the markers/heatmaps using the Google Maps JS API. It was fun.

 I also gathered some experience working with iBeacons.

## aentrópico
#### Branding · UI designer · Fronted Engineer

aentrópico was data science for the masses.

I designed the logo and the ui, and developed the frontend for all the prototypes of the user application.

Tools of trade:
In the first prototype: Coffeescript, Jade and SASS. AngularJS consuming a RESTful API developed in Rails.

In the other prototypes: Javascript, Jade and Stylus. AngularJS consuming a not RESTful API developed in Node.

The screenshots shown are actual screenshots from the browser of the latter prototypes.

## Vlipco
#### Cofounder · CTO · UI Designer · Frontend Engineer · illustator

Founded in 2011 Vlipco pretended to balance the online payment panorama in Colombia, so small business could also take part of the huge acceleration of the local e-commerce.

I worked there until July 2014. As a cofounder I worked on lots of different things: coding both frontend and backend, designing UI, documents and presentations, raising capital and whatnot.

The following are high-res mockups made in sketch.

The following are screenshots of a checkout process. This is one of the projects I feel proudest of. The final version weighted less than 300kB, and even the font files were optimized to keep only the used glyphs. Sadly due to business reasons it never touched a single user.

#### Second Round Investment Video

Here you can watch a video we wrote, designed and animated for the second round of funding. We hired the voice through VoiceBunny. It was made in After Effects.

## Fundación Help
#### CTO  · All things technical

Launched in February 2015, Fundación Help is the first crowdfunding platform to help students with financial difficulties complete their higher education in Colombia.

So far we've raised money to help four students finish their undergrad studies. The second round is to be started within a month to help three new students.

I developed the whole platform, using AngularJS and Parse.

## Paloma & Angostura ( Web Designer )

Paloma & Angostura is a basics clothing brand which employs former colombian combatants (demobilized from the FARC and the AUC)

Hosted on Shopify I simply helped to design and implement the theme.

The page isn't public yet due to integration issues with the payment platform.

The following are screenshots from various parts of the website.

## Misc

I thought it would be interesting to share here other stuff I've made, not necessarily work related.

#### Illustration - Graphics

I like to draw in my free time, I even switched one semester to Arts just to went back to Systems Engineering! I've done some illustrations.

These were made for The Blank Factory Website back in 2012.

#### The Analogue Chat Machine

Originally known as The Analogous Chat Machine

Selected to be made on the "Interactivos? 2010" held in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The machine was built using two mechanical typewriters, pulleys and strings. The machine would replicate the messages written in either machine on the other, allowing the users to effectively chat. It was super hard to build, and I couldn't have made it without the help of two collaborators: Gastón Gontero and Rafael Casamenor.

The machine stopped working after two days in a gallery with public access.

#### CSSP

The first and only compiler I've made was a CSS preprocessor in Python back in 2010.

The idea was simply to allow variables and inheritance.

I didn't actually used, or for that matter knew much about CSS so the project didn't made it past the most basic (and personal) functional state.

The github repo is here: https://github.com/fpinzn/cssp (I wasn't much into documentation back then)

#### 3D Annotations in Immersive Environments

I developed this project as my undergrad thesis in The Institut Image @ Chalon-Sur-Saône, France (Trivia: this is the town were photography was invented).

The idea was to allow users of immersive environments, take 'pictures' and annotate them in a practical manner. Using a tablet attached to a tracker and wireless streaming of the rendered scene (from a pc to the tablet), it behaved as if the tablet was a camera that could photograph the virtual scene.

As far as I know the idea was further developed by doctorate candidates working there.
